`neoc` is a small and simple utility to interact with
[Neocities](http://neocities.org). Refer to
[this page](http://phikal.neocities.org/blog/neoc.html) for more information on how
to use `neoc`.

To build, make sure you have a local [Go](https://golang.org/)
instaltation. When set up, run `go install` or `go build`. No
external dependencies are required.
